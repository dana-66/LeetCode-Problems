// 242. Valid Anagram

// which algorithm is better:
// Comparison
// Frequency Counting Method
// Pros:
//     1- Time Complexity: 
//       O(n), where ùëõ is the length of the strings.Counting characters and comparing dictionaries are both linear operations.

//     2-Space Complexity: 
//         O(1) (constant space) in terms of the alphabet size. The space required is proportional to the number of unique characters in the input strings, which is fixed for a given alphabet (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters).
// Cons:

// Implementation Complexity: Slightly more code and logic are required to implement the character counting and comparison.


// Sorting Method
// Pros:

//     1- Simplicity: Very concise and easy to understand. The implementation is just one line of code.
//     2- Ease of Use: It leverages built-in array methods, which makes it straightforward and less error-prone.

// Cons:
//     Time Complexity:  O(nlogn), where n is the length of the strings. This is due to the sorting step, which is more expensive than linear time.

//     Space Complexity: O(n), because sorting algorithms typically require additional space proportional to the input size.

// Which is Better?
//     For Small Inputs: If the input strings are relatively short, the difference in performance between O(n) and O(nlogn) might not be significant, making the sorting method's simplicity an attractive choice.

//     For Large Inputs: If performance is critical, especially with long strings, the frequency counting method is generally better due to its linear time complexity.

//     Readability and Maintainability: For quick, readable code, the sorting method is often preferable. For robust, performance-sensitive applications, the frequency counting method might be a better choice despite its added complexity.


// Conclusion
//     -Use the Sorting Method when you prioritize simplicity and ease of implementation, and performance is not a critical concern.
    
//     -Use the Frequency Counting Method when you need better performance for large inputs or want to avoid the overhead of sorting.
